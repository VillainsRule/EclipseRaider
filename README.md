    <h2>Why Eclipse?</h2>
</div>

- The tool has advanced & user-friendly guides on running the tool - it's easy!
- Everything is open source, not a suspicious .exe or .pkg you need to trust.
- There's no "paid version" or requirement - it's fully free!
- The interface is simple & function-focused.
- The tool is (mostly) quick.
- The tool is regularly updated & patched!

<br>
<h2 align="center">Installation</h2>

1. Install the Current [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) version.
2. Open your Terminal or Powershell and enter `git clone https://github.com/VillainsRule/EclipseRaider && cd EclipseRaider`.
    - If it says 'git' is not known or some other similar error, [download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and try again.
3. This created a folder named `EclipseRaider` in your root user. Create a file there named `tokens.txt`, and add account tokens.
4. Run `npm i && node.` to install our dependencies and start raiding!

It's that simple!<br>

To run the tool again later, just run this command in the terminal: `cd EclipseRaider && node .`

<h2 align="center">Captchas</h2>

This bot does not solve captchas, mainly due to the fact that I don't want to pay for captcha services to test it.<br>
If you care enough, make a PR.
